# Basic-Project
A Python basic project (Version 1.3)

This is a python basic project, that I'm still workin' on (and intend to transform it in a real big one)

What we have for now:
- Main menu with the options: Math, Calendar, Game and Exit.
- Math function is able to calculate addition, subtraction, multiplication, exponentiation and division.
- Calendar function is able to navigate between calendars of previous years and the coming years based on input.
- Game menu with the options: Guess the number and Tic tac toe

Updates:
- Currency converter feature was added
- Game menu has new options:  Roll the dice and Rock, paper or scissors
- Code optimization
- Some parts of the code were implemented with OO code

Next updates:
- Updates for the math menu
- Object-Oriented code
- Recursive functions
