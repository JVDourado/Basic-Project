# Basic-Project
A Python basic project (Version 1.3)

This is a python basic project, that I'm still workin' on (and intend to transform it in a real big one)

What we have for now:
- Main menu with the options: Math, Calendar, Game, Currency and Exit.
- Math function is able to calculate addition, subtraction, multiplication, exponentiation and division.
- Calendar function is able to navigate between calendars of previous years and the coming years based on input.
- Game menu with the options: Guess the number; Tic tac toe; Roll the dice; Rock paper or scissors.

Updates:

Next updates:
- Updates for the math menu
