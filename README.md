# Basic-Project
A Python basic project (Version 1.0)

This is a python basic project, that I'm still workin on (and intend to transform it in a real big one)

What we have for now:
- Main menu with the options: Math, Calendar and Exit
- Math menu with the options: Previous menu, Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Square Root, Exponentiation and Division

Updates:
-Now the calendar function is more interactive, being able to navigate between calendars of previous years and the coming years based on input, in addition we have the option to return to the main menu

Next updates:
- New features for the math menu and main menu
- Object-Oriented code
- Recursive functions
